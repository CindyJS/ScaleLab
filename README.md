# ScaleLab

This is part of the Lalalab exhibition of [IMAGINARY](https://lalalab.imaginary.org).
The exhibit contains an interactive piano, where the tuning and timbre can be interactively modified and analyzed through an attached MIDI-keyboard and touch-screen.

It is based on the [CindyJS](https://cindyjs.org)-framework.
